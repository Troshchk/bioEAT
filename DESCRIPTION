Description: The aim of bioEAT is to provide functionality to explore data, make gene annotation exhaustive and simplify the gene IDs translation between different organisms.
    For the data exploration:
    - find the non-overlapping elements of two vectors with outersect()
    - get main n pca components with get_main_pca()
    - calculate the logFold change between two dataframe columns and order the result with logfc()
    For the data annotation:
    - use OrgDB and maRt in one function with conv_ids_full().
